3.  A browser tab will open when you click on Fetch

4.  As the tool opens you may generate a geo-fence by drawing shapes on the provided map to collect coordinates. Simply close the shape you are drawing to see the latitude and logitude for each shape you create.

5.  If the CSV is correctly configured you will see a preview map. If not, the collapsable Manage Ingested Data window allows you to select the number of header lines to remove, filter for specific time frames, and average/consolidate points for a time interval (ex. 1 point every 5 minutes).  **The CSV file MUST contain columns labeled "Latitude" and "Longitude".**

9.  KML Map labels are assigned by selecting a column. Descriptions can be assigned to each location to provide additional information about that point. The data in that column will appear with map points on Google Earth.After making the appropriate selections for your data set, hit the Generate KML button.  Your map will be saved to your Documents folder in a directory named Fetch_Maps.
