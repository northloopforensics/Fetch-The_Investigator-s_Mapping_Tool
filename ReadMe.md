4.  Provide a name for the map you wish to create and select the CSV file with your map data

5.  If the CSV is correctly configured you will see a preview map. If not, the collapsable Manage CSV window allows you to select the number of header lines to remove from the CSV.  **The CSV file MUST contain columns labeled "Latitude" and "Longitude".**  The lack of a preview map does **NOT** mean KML is unable to be produced.

6.  Map labels are assigned by selecting a column.  The data in that column will appear with map points on Google Earth.

7.  Descriptions can be assigned to each location to provide additional information about that point.

8.  Data sets that include accuracy or distance-from-point data can also be populated.

9.  After making the appropriate selections for your data set, hit the Generate KML button.  Your map will be saved to your Documents folder in a directory named Locus_Maps.
